A common introductory object-oriented programming exercise is to write a matrix arithmetic program. Feeling ambitious, and thinking it to be a great way to practice pointer manipulation in C++, I thought I might generalize this to a general tensor arithmetic program: have the objects start out as empty pointers to arrays of the proper type, and define their dimensions later.

Matrix addition is up; I just need to work on output and matrix multiplication, and I will have something for matrix arithmetic. From there, I plan to redefine matrix multiplication in a form that more closely resembles the Einstein summation convention; and due to the use of the comma to indicate time differentiation, indices will be space-separated -- although since, for the time being, all tensors considered will be constant, this notation will be of no use herein, and I really don't feel like implementing rules for symbolic differentiation. Upper indices will be written first, followed by lower, and the division between them will be denoted by a semicolon. So, for example, a command for matrix multiplication may be written Matrix1[i; j]Matrix2[j; k]. From here, it should be a simple matter to generalize to tensor operations. If an index appears more than once either before or after the semicolon, this will result in an error.
