A common introductory object-oriented programming exercise is to write a matrix arithmetic program.
Feeling ambitious, and thinking it to be a great way to practice pointer manipulation in C++, I thought I might generalize this to a general tensor arithmetic program:
have the objects start out as empty pointers to arrays of the proper type, and define their dimensions later.
This has proven to be a headache. I am probably going to take a step back, do a proper matrix program first to make sure I have the concepts straight,
and generalize at a later date -- as I should have done originally.
